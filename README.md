## Hexagonal Pathfinder

There is a playable build in the folder Build.

The project is designed for 1920x1080 screens but will work fine for other resolutions.
Depending on the variety of the target screens, some quick modifications can be done on the CanvasScaler component.

To demonstrate the UI flexibility, a window-mode build was generated to facilitate the scaling and testing.
